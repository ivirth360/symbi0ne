- Background color: Very dark desaturated violet (#1A1A2E), for an immersive feel that helps glowing elements stand out.
- Accent color: Deep indigo (#6A5ACD), to bring some additional moodiness and drama into highlights and CTAs.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif with a techy feel, used for headings.
- Body font: 'Inter', a neutral sans-serif for body text and longer content.
- Use glowing, animated glyphs to represent modules, services, and assets, providing a visual language that resonates with the symbolic ecosystem.
- Design a modular layout that balances information with visual elements. Cards for memberships, timelines for roadmap, and interactive sections for demos.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as glyph animations on hover and pulsating trails leading to CTAs, to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
